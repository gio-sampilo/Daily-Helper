# Daily-Helper

*My motivation was to create daily planner that could be of use to the user by enabling the user to schedule their daily activities and have them stored for future reference. Through the use of JavaScript and CSS I was able to create an interactive and accessible webpage. The purpose of this project was to make planning the day a simple and efficient task.

*HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used in this project.
